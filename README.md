# plates

A neat CLI program to manage file (tem)plates.

This project is very much inspired from [copier], and borrows

## Usage example

1. Create a template at `~/.config/plates/templates`:

```bash
plates render my-new-project
```

## Building

The project is managed with Cargo, so everything should work fine out of the box.
